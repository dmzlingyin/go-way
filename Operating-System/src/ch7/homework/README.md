ARG policy FIFO
ARG jlist 200,200,200

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 2 ( length = 200.0 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 0 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 200.00 )
  [ time 200 ] Run job 1 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 400.00 )
  [ time 400 ] Run job 2 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 600.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 200.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 200.00  Turnaround 400.00  Wait 200.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 400.00  Turnaround 600.00  Wait 400.00

  Average -- Response: 200.00  Turnaround 400.00  Wait 200.00

Q4
A: there are two types of workloads can make SJF and FIFO has the same turnaround time:
    (1): the jobs has same running time.
    (2): the jobs has same arriving time if they has no same running time.

Q5
A: the jobs running time are is same and equal's RR's quantum lengths.

Q6
A: Increase

Q7
A: Increase
